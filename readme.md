We integrate blockchain technology with U.S. educational policy to allow for greater transparency and accessibility to school budgeting decisions and federal funding. With our interface, schools and government funds can keep track of where their assets go and transfer these assets quickly and securely. We aim to provide a platform by which policy analysts may evaluate the impact of various educational funding bills and by which the public may hold institutions accountable for efficiently allocating their taxpayer dollars.
