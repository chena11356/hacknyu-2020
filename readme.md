We integrate blockchain technology with U.S. educational policy to allow for greater transparency and accessibility to school budgeting decisions and federal funding. With our interface, schools and government funds can keep track of where their assets go and transfer these assets quickly and securely. We aim to provide a platform by which policy analysts may evaluate the impact of various educational funding bills and by which the public may hold institutions accountable for efficiently allocating their taxpayer dollars.

Through our background research, we identified numerous systemic problems within the American education system, including stagnating teacher salaries, crumbling infrastructure, lack or misuse of funds, and lack of transparency of funds. While our project primarily addresses that last issue, our model crucially allows proposed policy solutions for other aspects of educational finance—tripling federal Title 1 grants to $45 billion, raising minimum starting teacher salary to $60,000, Educational Freedom Scholarships—to be thoroughly researched via the transaction-tracking capabilities of blockchain.

We are founded heavily upon the Stellar blockchain network and we are very grateful for all their support!
